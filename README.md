The number guessing game is based on a concept where the player guesses a number in ranges from one to Hundred. If the player guesses the exact number then the player wins else the player loses the game. Since this game provides limited attempts, so, the player must guess the number with the limited attempts.The system generates a random number from a given range between 1 to 100.The approach is to generate a random number using the Math.random() method in Java.
